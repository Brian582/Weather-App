# Weather-App

This weather app allows users to search the weather in a state or country anywhere in the world.

The app uses the OpenWeather API to search for the weather data about a state/country. 

It first needs to make a call to the GeoCoding API to get the longitude and latitude of the state/country. 
After that, it can call the Weather API to get the weather data.

This weather app only prints out the weather and temperature of a state/country.
